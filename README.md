# Fall Detection Using AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This solution is use AI to detect and recognise someone has fallen via a CCTV or camera.


## Background

The aging of the population is a common problem faced by many countries (Such as my country, Singapore). Hope to develop an artificial intelligence system to detect whether a person has fallen via a camera. With this system, we can react and provide assistance more quickly when the elderly in the family fall down. In addition, this system can also be used in hospitals and nursing homes.


## How is it used?

The main object of this system is used to help elderly that let them can get rescue and assistance quickly when they fall. To detect whether a person has fallen via a CCTV or camera. When detected someone has fallen, system can quickly send a notification to another family member.


## Data sources and AI methods
We need to collect the data of human fall pattern through image and also video. The AI techniques to use to this AI project will be Video Recognition.

## Challenges

In a dark environment, this system may not be able to detect someone has fallen via the CCTV or camera accurately. Besides, we may need deploy multiple camera or CCTV to cover every angle and corner.

## What next?

Would like to use same technique and concept (Video Recognition) to detect fire via CCTV or camera. This system is not only useful and helpful to protect home and office, but also can use in forest.
